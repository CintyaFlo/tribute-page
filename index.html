                <p>Until 1964, the year he left Brazil due to the military coup, he carried out an academic career and
                    public activities in parallel. Journalist and editor of the newspaper A Tarde (1954-1964), professor
                    of human geography at the Catholic University of Salvador (1956-1960), full professor of human
                    geography at the Federal University of Bahia where he creates the Geosciences Laboratory, will be
                    director of the Official Press da Bahia (1959-1961), president of the Bahia State Economic Planning
                    Commission Foundation (1962-1964), and representative of the Civil House of President Janio Quadros
                    in Bahia, in 1961. His research and publications at the time focus on local realities. , mainly the
                    capital – the doctoral thesis is entitled O Centro da Cidade de Salvador– as well as the cities and
                    the Recôncavo region.</p>

                <h3>1964-1977. a traveling researcher</h3>

                <p>In 1964, he began an international career imposed by the political situation in Brazil. First in
                    France, visiting professor at the universities of Toulouse, Bordeaux and Paris-Sorbonne, and at
                    IEDES (Institute for the Study of Economic and Social Development). From 1971 to 1977, he began a
                    truly itinerant career, at the mercy of invitations: at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology –
                    Boston) as a researcher; and as a visiting professor at the universities of Toronto (Canada),
                    Caracas (Venezuela), Dar-es-Salam (Tanzania), Columbia University (New York). This period opens a
                    long path towards theorizing in geography, with the intense use of the rich libraries of the great
                    universities. First an enlargement of the focus with the book Les Villes Du Tiers Monde, 1971, where
                    there is already an interest in studying the peculiarities of the urban economy of the so-called
                    underdeveloped countries, characterized by its two circuits, upper and lower, and resulting in the
                    book L'Espace Partagé: les deux circuits de l'économie des pays sous -développés published in French
                    in 1975, in English and Portuguese in 1979.</p>


                <h3>1977-2001. An engaged researcher</h3>

                <p>n 1977, he returned to Brazil. Two years pass before he is able to return to teaching at the
                    Brazilian university, first at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, from 1979 to 1983, the year
                    in which he enters by competition at the University of São Paulo, full professor of human geography
                    until his compulsory retirement. , receiving the title of Professor Emeritus at USP in 1997 and
                    continuing to research, publish and mentor students until the end of his life. He was officially
                    reinstated at the Federal University of Bahia in 1995, from which he had been dismissed for
                    “absence”. Twelve Brazilian universities and seven foreign universities awarded him the title of
                    Doctor Honoris Causa.</p>
                <p>In 1994, he received the Vautrin Lud International Geography Prize. In this last phase of his
                    journey, he published Por uma Geografia Nova, from the critique of geography to a critical geography
                    (1978), a contribution to the effervescence and eagerness to renew this science in Brazil . Space is
                    defined as an active social instance, the notion of socio-spatial formation introduced. The
                    resulting research, classes and publications intend an epistemological effort to provide Latin
                    American geography with appropriate categories of analysis.</p>
                <p>The study of the technical-scientific-informational environment should make it possible to understand
                    the organization of space in the current historical period. Technique, space, time: globalization
                    and informational technical-scientific milieu (1994), From totality to place (1996), Metamorphosis
                    of inhabited space (1997), are some of these publications that lead to his major work (his major
                    book?) : The Nature of Space (1996), which wants to be “a general theory of human space, a
                    contribution of geography `reconstruction of social theory”. Finally, in 2000, he publishes For
                    another globalization, from single thought to universal consciousness.</p>

            <h2>Published Books</h2>
            <p>The exile lived during the period of the Military Dictatorship in Brazil when Milton Santos lived and
                taught in several countries, allowed the author to have a more comprehensive look at the socio-spatial
                differences between developed and underdeveloped countries. His look forged in a context of poverty
                allowed him to see, theorize and build different concepts in more than 40 books published throughout his
                life. In this section we will present his most prominent books.</p>

            <p><b>A Natureza do Espaço: </b> In "A Natureza do Espaço", Milton Santos discusses the concept of space
                geographical area, associating it with the evolution of techniques and the notions of object and action,
                understood as
                systems and analyzed in this way. Furthermore, the author addresses several issues, such as the period
                information experienced since the 1970s, the growth of geographic networks, the intensification of
                globalization process, the constitution of the informational technical-scientific environment, among
                others.</p>

            <p><b>Por uma Geografia Nova: </b> About twenty years ago, when the first edition of Por
                A New Geography, geography was experiencing an internal crisis all over the world, imposing on science
                the need
                methodological, conceptual and epistemological discussions. The publication of this book contributed
                for the critical renewal of geography: The truth, however, is that everything is subject to the law of
                movement and
                renewal, including the sciences. The new is not invented, it is discovered , the author proposes in the
                introduction
                of what has become a classic book ever since. Milton Santos contributed with this work to the
                overcoming the impasses that presented themselves, proposing an accurate analysis of the object of
                science: space,
                showing the need to make it truly human, relating it to other related disciplines.
            </p>

            <p><b>por uma outra Globalizaçao: </b> A classic of the human sciences. Rarely is a work born as
                a
                classic. This is, without a doubt, the case of For another globalization: from single thought to
                consciousness
                universal, by Milton Santos. The geographer defends the idea that a new interpretation of the world is
                needed
                contemporary, a multidisciplinary analysis, which is able to highlight the ideology in the production of
                history, in addition to showing the limits of its discourse in the face of the reality experienced by
                most countries
                of the world. Information and money turned out to be villains, as most of the
                population has no access to either. They are the pillars of a situation in which technical progress is
                leveraged by a small number of global actors for their exclusive benefit. Result:
                deepening competitiveness, the confusion of spirits and the growing impoverishment of the masses,
                while governments are not able to regulate collective life. The themes highlight the manifestations
                little
                studied from the country below, from culture to politics, a reasoning that also applies to the country
                itself.
                periphery of the world capitalist system, whose centrality is presented as a new dynamic factor of
                story. It is precisely because these actors, effective but still little studied, are largely
                present that Santos believed that the current globalization was not irreversible, and was convinced that
                the
                universal history is just beginning. Milton Santos recognizes the beginning of a positive evolution in
                the
                small reactions that occur in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Maybe this could be the way
                will lead to the establishment of another globalization.Por another globalization brings a message of
                hope in the construction of a new, less excluding universalism.</p>

            <p><b>Espaço e Método: </b> In these essays written in the 1980s, Milton Santos reflects on the
                theoretical-methodological tools necessary to critically interpret the world through space and
                its dynamics. The book offers significant propositions for understanding the active role of space in
                movement of the social totality. The author insists on the need to elaborate a periodization from the
                understanding of the present to analyze, at each historical moment, the combination of variables that
                make up
                certain subspace. This method path allows you to explain the transformation of the technical medium into
                technical-scientific environment, attributing a central role to intellectual work and the circulation
                process. THE
                The search for understanding the spatial dialectic is also present in the definition of space as a field
                of
                force, including the conflict between the old and the new, between external and internal forces, between
                the
                and the market.</p>

            <p><b>O Brasil - Território e sociedade no início do século XXI: </b> Brazil: territory and society at the
                beginning of the 21st century", by Milton Santos and Maria Laura Silveira, deals with the territory as
                an expression of Brazil, as well as its uses and intention of use in the
                technical-scientific-informational environment.
                The territory described by the authors is the site of the dynamics of guild transformations by
                population, cities, economy, politics, techniques, fixed and flows of capital, information, people,
                goods and orders. Emphasis is given to the different ways in which the territory can be presented, among
                them, the transition from the natural environment to the technical-scientific-informational environment.
                The formulation of the concept of "territorial division of labor" is also observed. For the writers,
                this phenomenon creates a hierarchy of places that assume certain classifications regarding their
                functions and determines the power of action of the individual, being responsible for the regional
                inequality that becomes the basis of the regionalization of the "four Brazils".
                It is an excellent work to understand Brazil from the insertion of its territory in the
                technical-scientific-informational environment, but the language can be complex, given the large amount
                of numbers, statistical data, tables and maps, that is, the work requires a little more attention.</p>
